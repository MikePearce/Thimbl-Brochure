        Welcome to thimbl, the free, open source, distributed micro-blogging platform. 
        If you're tired of being locked in to one micro-blogging platform, or a single
        social network. Or you're weary of corporations hi-jacking your updates in
        the pursuit of money, then thimbl is for you.

        Thimbl is currently not ready for the world! We're still putting the finishing
        touches on what we hope will be a useful and successful application. In the
        meantime, <a href='#about' class='menu'>read more about it</a> or 
        <a href='#contributors' class='menu'>find out how you can help</a> or simply
        <a href='#contact' class='menu'>find out what we're up to</a> on the social
        networks you'd love to get away from.
