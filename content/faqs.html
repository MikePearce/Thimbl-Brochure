        There's plenty to say about thimbl, from the reason we're doing it, to 
        the way we're doing and and even the why.

    <h3>Isn't this just like identi.ca/ostatus.net/other open network?</h3>
    <p>
        The similarity is only superficial, in that we draw upon similarities with 
        web2.0 platforms in how we communicate our use-case. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Diaspora, Crabgrass, NoseRub, StatusNet, identi.ca and the rest are just web-apps 
        with some sort of federation bolted-on. None of them are truly distributed 
        milti-tier systems like the classic internet applications 
        (email/usenet/irc/finger). Thimbl, on the otherhand, is just a finger & ssh 
        client that illustrates that "microblogging" has already been possible on 
        the internet for decades by simply presenting the data differently and 
        making it look like the now-familiar twitter interface. You don't need 
        anything from the Thimbl project running on your server to participate in 
        Thimbl, just the software that is already in your repository, namely, ssh 
        and xinetd/finger or compatible alternatives. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Like the classic Internet applications, each of Thimbl tiers are 
        themselves distributed, scalable and transparently interoperable with 
        other instances. As a result, Thimbl has far fewer barriers to adoption, 
        it can be hosted cheaply on existing commonly available infrastructure and extends 
        widely available and supported platforms. This also means that Thimbl 
        requires a lot less development than those others. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another major difference is that those projects are delusional, utopian 
        undertakings that seek to overthrow proprietary platforms by simply writing 
        software, which is why they will remain marginal, used only by niche users. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Thimbl is as much as performance as a platform, it incorporates the 
        critical message of Telekommunisten and doesn't loose track of the fact 
        that Capital is a much bigger factor than software in determining the 
        adoption of a platform. The idea of Thimbl is much more important than 
        Thimbl itself.

    <h3>What do I need to make this work?</h3>
    <p>
        Finger and SSH. Really.
    </p>
    <a name="oStatus"></a>
    <h3>Is it going to work with oStatus?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes, we hope so. We want to get the first version done first, which just
        needs finger and SSH. Then we'll start implementing other methods.
    </p>
    <a name="twitter"></a>
    <h3>Will Thimbl be an alternative to Twitter?</h3>
    <p>
        Well, proprietary, centralized platforms like Twitter are exactly what I'm 
        trying to illustrate are unneeded, a step backward from what we already 
        have in the classic internet platforms, and exist only to capture profit. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While I certainly hope that Thimbl is useful and grows, like all other 
        Telekommunisten "products," it's purpose is primarily symbolic. I'm the 
        last person to argue that all some unfunded collective of activists needs 
        to do to defeat web2.0 is write some nice software. That is simply not the 
        case. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If there can be an alternative to Twitter, a very well funded and 
        positioned corporation, it must be a platform, not simply an alternative 
        service or some clone-ware. 
    </p>
    <p>
        That said, pushing Thimbl as a far as we can is part of the performance, 
        if somehow despite our overt rejection of finance capital, Thimbl 
        explodes beyond it's art/hacker/activist community target audience and 
        becomes more than an artwork, but a legitimate platform, that would be 
        fantastic.

    <h3>Will you be part of the federated web</h3>
    <p>
       Yes, once we get thimbl kickstarted, maybe we can convince all these 
       people that the way forward is not to throw out everything the working 
       internet and it's millions of running servers is actually based on and 
       replace it all from the wire up with something invented yesterday, using 
       code, that if it exists at all, is not part of even a single software 
       repository on the planet anywhere except (maybe) some guy's github account.
    </p>            
    <p>
       Instead, let's use what we currently have and make that more awesome.

    <h3>Can this approach be used with other social networks?</h3>
    <p>
        We'd like to think so, yes. Maybe one day the open web will be all that
        there is. Time will tell. ;)
