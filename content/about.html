    The Open Web can aspire to continue the peer-to-peer legacy 
    of the classic internet applications. Decentralized platforms 
    such as Usenet, email and IRC where not controlled by any one
    organization, and do not directly capture profit. The web has 
    been the focus of the commercialization of the internet due 
    to it's client-server architecture that gives full control to 
    the website operator. This control is required by the logic of  
    Capitalist finance in order to capture value. Without such control 
    profit-seeking investors do not provide funds.
</p>
<p>                        
    However, this control comes at a cost. Centralized systems are 
    far less efficient at managing online communications than decentralized 
    systems. The corporate, web-based communication-platforms that emerged 
    under the "Web 2.0" monicker are hungry for more than just 
    Capital, the huge datacenters required to run them also consume 
    massive natural resources and energy, and cause massive amounts 
    of pollution. And yet desipite all, these platforms still 
    commonly experience scaling issues and frequent outages, straining 
    under the profit-imposed need to centralize control. And this is so, 
    in a world where the majority of the global population does in 
    practical terms not have access to the internet. Of course, 
    environmental concerns are not the only issue with overly 
    centralized systems, perhaps even of greater concern are the 
    implications for privacy and freedom of speech and association 
    when control of our social technology is held by only a few 
    private corporations.

<p>
    Lost in the hype of the "Social Web" is the fact that the 
    Internet has always been about sharing: Usenet, Email and IRC 
    have been enabling social connections, including citizen journalism, 
    photo sharing, and other features of recent web-based systems.

    Thimbl demonstrates the potential for integrating classic 
    internet technologies into the Open Web. On the surface, Thimbl 
    appears to be yet another microblogging service, simular to 
    twitter or identi.ca. However, Thimbl is a specialized web-based 
    client for a User Information protocol called Finger. The Finger 
    Protocol was orginally developed in the 1970s, and as such, 
    is already supported by all existing server platforms.
</p>
<p>
    Thimbl offers no way to "Sign Up." It is up your own webhost, 
    Internet service-provider or system administrator to provide 
    accounts. Virtually every server on the intenret already has 
    Finger server software available in its software repository. 
    All that is required for any organisation to provide Thimbl 
    accounts is simply turn their finger service on. In most cases, 
    this would take the server administator no more than a few 
    minutes, after which all of their users could log in to 
    thimble.net and participate.
</p>
<p>
    Thimbl is a call to arms for users to demand their sever administrators 
    turn on their Finger service! But more that that, Thimbl has embedded 
    within it a vision for the Open Web that goes beyond the web. For the web 
    to be truly open it must integrate pervasivaly in to the internet as a 
    whole. The internet has always has been much more than the web.
