        Welcome to thimbl, the free, open source, distributed micro-blogging platform. 
        If you're tired of being locked in to one micro-blogging platform, or a single
        social network. Or you're weary of corporations hi-jacking your updates in
        the pursuit of money, then thimbl is for you.
