        Welcome to thimbl, the free, open source, distributed micro-blogging platform. 
        If you're tired of being locked in to one micro-blogging platform, or a single
        social network. Or you're weary of corporations hi-jacking your updates in
        the pursuit of money, then thimbl is for you.

            Thimbl is currently not ready for the world! We're still putting the finishing
            touches on what we hope will be a useful and successful application.

            This is excellent news as it's been one of the goals of Thimbl as a means
            to spread the word since it's inception. Thanks to everyone on the team who helped
            make this happen. Now we need to finish the application and make
            sure everyone knows about it!
